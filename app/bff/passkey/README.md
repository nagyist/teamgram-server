# Telegram passkey

Telegram recently introduced support for passkeys, allowing users to log in instantly using biometrics (Face ID, fingerprints) or a device PIN instead of relying on SMS verification codes. 


## How to Set Up a Telegram Passkey
- **Update Your App:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Telegram (v12.2.3+ on iOS, v12.2.8+ on Android, or v6.3.6+ on Desktop).

- **Navigate to Settings:** Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Passkeys.
Create Passkey: Tap Create Passkey. Your device will generate a unique cryptographic key.

- **Verify:** Authenticate using your device's biometric system (Face ID/Touch ID) or PIN to save the passkey to your device's keychain or password manager. 

## Key Benefits
- **No SMS Needed:** Logging in works even if you have no cellular service or if SMS delivery is interrupted.

- **Phishing Protection:** Passkeys are tied to the official Telegram website and cannot be used on fake or malicious sites.

- **Sync Across Devices:** Passkeys can be synced via iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or third-party tools like Bitwarden. 

## Important Notes
- **Keep Your SIM:** You still need an active phone number linked to your account; passkeys are an alternative login method, not a replacement for the phone number requirement.

- **Local Passcode vs. Passkey:** Do not confuse this with the "Passcode Lock" feature. A Passcode Lock protects the app on your current device from physical access, while a Passkey is used for logging into your account on new devices. 



## Passkeys
You can now create a passkey on your device to instantly log in to Telegram with a PIN or biometric data like Face ID and fingerprints — instead of an SMS code.

Passkeys work anywhere, any time — even if you’re traveling, spending winter on an isolated beach, or your SMS service is interrupted.

The unique encrypted keys for your Passkeys are stored on your device — and can be synced with password management apps from iCloud, Google and more. This makes passkeys not only the fastest way to log in, but also the most secure.

> To create a passkey, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Passkeys — you can do this on any device. Read more in our FAQ.

But don't throw away your SIM card yet! Even with a passkey enabled, make sure that your account is registered to an active phone number you control.

## Q: What is a Passkey?
If you are already logged in to Telegram on a device, you can create a passkey that allows you to enter your Telegram account the same way you unlock your device. With a passkey, you can log in to your device simply by entering a PIN code or biometric data like your Face ID or fingerprint scan.

Passkeys are an additional login method that can be used instead of SMS to instantly enter your account – even if you are traveling or don't have SMS service. Passkeys are also more secure than SMS codes, helping protect users from unauthorized access to their account.

> Your passkeys can be managed in Settings > Privacy and Security > Passkeys from any app — which shows detailed info for each of your passkeys, like their creation date and when they were last used to log in.

If you have a password manager like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager or another third-party service, you can use it to back up your passkey in case you upgrade or lose access to your device.

> With a passkey, you can still request an SMS code in order to log in – so always make sure your account uses an up-to-date phone number that is controlled by you. For even more security, you can add an extra password to your account that is required each time you log in.
